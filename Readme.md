# All-Seeing Eye - An editor for Guxt
It's an editor for [Guxt](https://www.cavestory.org/pixels-works/guxt.php)!

You can edit stages (tiles + entities), tileset attributes, and quickly scramble/unscramble images

## How to use
Basic controls are similar to Boosters Lab and Cave Editor, but the structure of the editor is very different.

Check out the [Manual](Manual.md) for more detailed information on what the buttons do, and [Modding101](Modding101.md) for info on how Guxt works. 

## Building
It's just a regular VS2019 project, should build pretty normally.

Make sure you have [PixelModdingFramework](https://github.com/Brayconn/PixelModdingFramework), [WinFormsKeybinds](https://github.com/Brayconn/WinFormsKeybinds), and [LayeredPictureBox](https://github.com/Brayconn/LayeredPictureBox/) though.

## Running
On Windows you can just click the exe.

Mac/Linux you'll need [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/), and probably need to open it with `mono GuxtEditor.exe`
